# Earthquake-Nowcating
Statistical quantification of observed seismicity is important for understanding earthquake dynamics and future risk in any seismic-prone region. . In this paper, we implement the idea of nowcasting to examine the current uncertain state of earthquake hazard assessment in the seismically active and adjacent regions
